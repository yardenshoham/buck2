Buck starts with the leaf nodes of the graph, that is, targets that have no dependencies. Buck adds these to a queue of targets to build. When a thread is available, Buck removes a target from the front of the queue and builds it. Assuming the target builds successfully, Buck notifies all of the rules that depend on that target. When all of a rule's dependencies have been satisfied, Buck adds that rule's target to the build queue. Computation proceeds in this manner until all of the nodes in the graph have been built.

C/C++ compilation rules specify as inputs all headers found from the transitive closure of C/C++ library dependencies, even though in many cases only a small subset of these headers are actually used. For example, a C/C++ source file might use only one of many headers exported by a C/C++ library dependency. However, there's not enough information available before running the build to know if any given input is used, and so all inputs must be considered, which can lead to unnecessary rebuilding.\nIn some cases, after the build completes, Buck can figure out the exact subset of the listed inputs that were actually used.
