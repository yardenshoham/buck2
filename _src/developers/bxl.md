## Buck2 Extension Language (BXL)

BXL is a Starlark-based script that enables integrators to inspect and interact with the Buck2 graph.

Integrators are able to:

* Write Starlark code that queries, analyzes and builds the Buck2 graph.
* Interact with the Buck2 graph structures natively, via Starlark, in a safe, controlled manner.
