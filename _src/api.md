# APIs

A lot of Buck2 is driven by Starlark APIs. While there is a [Starlark specification](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md), for most purposes it can be considered a subset of Python. There are three main places you can write Starlark in Buck2:

* In `BUCK` files, where you can define the rules. The most interesting functions are [the rules themselves](rules), but you will often use the [builtin Starlark functions](starlark/globals) (most of which are the same as in Python), and a few of the [build functions](build/globals) (e.g. `glob`).
* In rule definitions, where you can use the same Starlark standard functions, but will heavily be using the [build functions](build/globals) (e.g. `rule` and `attrs`).
* In [BXL](../developers/bxl), where the [context type](bxl/bxl_ctx) is one of the more important ones.
